# Multiple-Linear-Regression-
When there are multiple predictors line and to get the best predict line we use Gradient Descent 

### Gradient Descent
When there are one or more inputs you can use a process of optimizing the values of 
the coefficients by iteratively minimizing the error of the model on your training data.
Gradient descent is done using a linear regression model because it is relatively straightforward to understand. and useful when you have a very large datasets

X = math, read
Y = write
